## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Affero distribution of RStuduio.  The code should run with no issues using RStudio versions 3.6.2.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" Wine data to better understand:

1. The fitting model according to data.
2. The different characteristic between red wine and white wine.
3. The influences of extreme points on model fitting.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a R file (including entire code) available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The R file is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://github.com/QianM2020/Wine-Alcoohol-linear-Regression-Analysis/blob/main/Wine%20Alcohol%20Linear%20Regression%20Analysis%20Math%20261%20Project%20II.pdf).
